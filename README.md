A check list for creating the documentation for the seminar Input/Output - basics of process oriented design ("Eingabe/Ausgabe. Grundlagen der prozessorientierten Gestaltung").  

### The thirteen commandments for getting a grade     

1. The repositories should have a meaningful name. Don't call them "Eingabe_Ausgabe_Projekt1" or I start puking. Also don't use "_"  and UPPERCASE in the names. Give your project a nice short name. You are designers come up with some ideas.   
2. The image names should all be lower case, short and unique. The thumbnail (64 × 64 px) images have the same name as the large (500 × 500 px) images but with the extension "thumb-". E.g. "myimage.png" has the thumbnail "myimage-thumb.png".  
3. The beauty shot(s) are representative images for your project. All in 1920 × 1080 px.  
4. You need to add a license to each repository. ["Choosing an OSS license doesn't need to be scary - ChooseALicense.com"](http://choosealicense.com/)  
5. You need to write comments into your source code.  
6. Your source code works or you need to have directions in your README.md how to install all dependencies and run your code.  
7. If you created a poster for the ISS project you need to provide your InDesign or Photoshop files as well.  
8. Your README.md is valid Markdown syntax. You can learn that [here](http://www.remarq.io/articles/five-minutes-to-markdown-mastery/)  
9. Add your data to this repository. Your data.json has to be valid JSON. you can validate it [here](http://jsonlint.com/)
10. Your documentation and README.mds should be written in English
11. your documentation and README.mds should allow the reader to reproduce your project (if it is source code) or at least (in case of the posters for the ISS project) fully understand what the gist is. This means you need to describe also the process of aggregating your data. All scraping steps and so on.  
12. Don't forget the microsite.  
13. Your deadline is the first of April. No joke.  

This repository contains examples for all the files you need to provide.  

- __Example-README.md__ (contains some examples on Markdown and what sections a README.md could have)
- __code__ The code folder should contain all your source code
- __data.json__ is the layout for your infos that will be part of the website
- __images__ The images folder contains examples for the images ignore the anim.gif and the canvas.png they are just for the Example-README.md
